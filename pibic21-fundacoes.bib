  abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a globally adapted methodology by government organisations and builders who conceive the integration of the organisation, planning, development and the digital construction model into a single project. In the case of a heritage building, the Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) approach is able to cover the comprehensive restoration of the building. In contrast to BIM applied to new buildings, HBIM can address different models which represent either periods of historical interpretation, restoration phases or records of heritage assets over time. Great efforts are currently being made to automatically reconstitute the geometry of cultural heritage elements from data acquisition techniques such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) or Structure From Motion (SfM) into BIM (Scan-to-BIM). Hence, this work advances on the parametric modelling from remote sensing point cloud data, which is carried out under the Rhino+Grasshopper-ArchiCAD combination. This workflow enables the automatic conversion of TLS and SFM point cloud data into textured 3D meshes and thus BIM objects to be included in the HBIM project. The accuracy assessment of this workflow yields a standard deviation value of 68.28 pixels, which is lower than other author’s precision but suffices for the automatic HBIM of the case study in this research.},

  abstract = {Ethnographic surveys of building processes rarely feature in mainstream architectural history. The curious dearth of studies derives perhaps more from the absence of a relevant methodological orientation and cross-disciplinary collaboration than a lack of serious interest in the building process itself. By drawing on building methods and know-how from an oral culture, in this essay, we propose that sentient building processes are useful means for constructing one seamless history that transcends limited disciplinary representations. We also pursue the possibilities of collaboration on ethnographic knowledge across vernacular architecture and anthropology. The essay discusses concepts and methods including visual methods. Informed by current anthropology, images are additionally utilised to interpret architectural temporality, a biographical view of dwelling, situated learning, technology–culture non-duality, and socio-spatial references. By intertwining a cross-disciplinary methodological position with methodological techniques and by tying conditions and potentials of human life to the very act of building, concerning an indigenous culture without any written history, we advocate vernacular architecture’s potential to complement mainstream architectural history.},

The case study is a room with an umbrella vault in Castel Masegra, located in Sondrio (Italy). The complexity of the room required an accurate geometric survey from a set of dense point clouds, from which a detailed BIM as well as 2D drawings were generated. Finally, a tetrahedral mesh was derived from the geometric model and was used to run a finite element analysis. The aim of this work is to describe the procedure developed and illustrate the main challenges found.},

These interpretations have been classified as the aesthetic/formalist interpretation, the typological approach, evolutionary theory, diffusionism of a social and geographical kind, physical explanations, social explanations and socia-cultural factors. This article reveals two dominant approaches: those that imply that vernacular buildings need not or cannot be studied historically, and those that explore the evolution of building types in very limited geographical contexts. In conclusion, a redefinition of a method for the study of vernacular architecture is requested and suggested by reference to a study which has employed this approach.},

  abstract = {The face of the world is changing and nowhere is this more evident than with vernacular buildings. They disappear or are extensively changed for a variety of reasons, from natural causes such as fire, storm and earthquake, to a wide variety of cultural causes including obsolescence and changes in fashion, function and lifestyle. All of these factors, subtle and not so subtle, work to alter the material culture of our planet. But change and constancy are two fundamental qualities of vernacular buildings and dwellings. Constancy permits the evolution of types and characteristics to be identified, even in widely spread locations. It helps trace the origins of structures, despite later modifications. And change allows one to trace the effects of difference in environment, fashion, cultural ideas and economic influences. Change and constancy operate together, although one or other may dominate at a particular time and place. In Vernacular Buildings Allen Noble extends the global survey contained in his earlier highly successful Traditional Buildings, to cover vernacular buildings and dwellings around the world. In a truly comprehensive account, he ranges from the farmsteads of pioneer Brazilian settlers, the Masai dwellings of Tanzania and the gothic houses of Shanghai, to Virginia Hall and Parlor houses, the thatched dwellings of the Eifel region of Germany and the three-decker houses of New York. Acknowledging the value of archival research the author is also firmly convinced of the importance of field observation and the book is extensively illustrated with photographs from his own personal collection. With a comprehensive bibliography, and incorporating new material from cultural geographers, historians, folklorists and anthropologists, Vernacular Buildings is a unique survey that will be welcomed by specialists and enthusiasts alike.},

utilizado para a construção de partedas edificações maranhenses, com ênfase na Capital do Estado, no período dos sec.

É feita uma análise comparativa entre os processos construtivosdos edifícios, construídos na 
Baixa deLisboa após o terremoto de 1755 e as edificadas no Bairro da Praia Grande em São 
Luis nos sec. XVIII e XIX. Busca evidenciar a presença dosistema construtivopombalino no 
Centro Históricode São Luis e estabelecer uma relação de características marcantesentre a 
arquitetura Pombalina da Baixa de Lisboa e a arquitetura implantada em São Luis durante os 
séculos XVIII e XIX. O entendimento deste sistema passa pela listagem das técnicas construtivas e materiais utilizados,  pela leitura do espaço interior dos edifícios,  pelo estudo do comportamento estrutural destes e pela sua valorização, nomeadamente no âmbito de Patrimônio Cultural da Humanidade,  apresentando a influência do sistema construtivo pombalino no Centro Histórico de São Luis como um marco característico da arquitetura e do urbanismo. Todo este estudo foi elaborado com os seguintes objetivos: alertar  para os  erros construtivos ocorridos em intervenções nas edificações do Centro Histórico da Capital maranhense,  prejudicando um patrimônio histórico pertencente a todos nós,  e fornecer bases para os critérios de recuperação destes edifícios, à luz dos usos e funcionalidades atuais. Além disso, o presente trabalho lança elementos para desenvolvimento de novas pesquisas, abrindopossibilidade de aprofundamento das questões estudadas, além de defender uma questão relativamente recente na cidade,  sobre os fundamentos teóricos e práticos da existência de uma “arquitetura pombalina” em São Luis-Ma. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ABSTRACT},
